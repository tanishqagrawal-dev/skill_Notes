# Professional UI Update

I have polished the Admin Console interface based on your feedback.

## Changes
1.  **Inputs**: Now use `admin-input` class for a glassmorphic look (dark translucent background).
2.  **Layout**: Better spacing and grouping in the "Assign Co-Admin" form.
3.  **Table**: Enhanced readability with avatars and status badges.
4.  **Fix**: Ensured `GlobalData` is safely accessed.

## Verification
Open **Command Center > Manage Co-Admins**. The form should look sleek and professional now.
